# ClockImageTimeConverter
Converts time to analog clock image, converts analog clock image to time.

## Create analog clock
Inorder to create an analog clock image (PNG format) call the *draw_analog_clock* method that's in the *ClockImageTimeConverter* class.
Usage example - create an analog clock that shows the time _10:15:00_:
```python
converter = ClockImageTimeConverter()
converter.draw_analog_clock(10, 15, 0)
```
## Convert analog clock image to time
Inorder to get the time shown in an analog clock image call the *get_time_from_clock_image* method that's in the *ClockImageTimeConverter* class.
```python
converter = ClockImageTimeConverter()
hour, minutes, seconds = converter.get_time_from_clock_image('my_analog_clock.png')
```
### Prequisites
Analog clock image must be of similar format to the image generated by *draw_analog_clock* method - this can be solved using bounding boxes.
